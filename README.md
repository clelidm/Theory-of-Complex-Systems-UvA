# Theory of Complex Systems
This repository contains the material of the course "theory of complex systems".

## Description
The course introduces students to the theory of complex systems with a main focus on critical phenomena. We will discuss the following topics: from microscopic to macroscopic description of complex systems, emergence, phase transitions, critical phenomena, universality, scale invariance, mean-field theory, renormalisation, and self-organized criticality. The course will focus mainly on equilibrium phase transitions, but will also touch upon phase transitions in dynamical systems.

We will work with simple models of complex systems, such as percolation and epidemic models, the Ising model, the linear voter model, Metropolis and Glauber dynamics, the TASEP model (a simple traffic model), the sandpile model, simple models of collective behavior, etc. Numerical simulations of the studied models will be briefly discussed in class, but not implemented. The course will be illustrated with examples of complex systems taken from various fields of science (e.g., physics, neuroscience, social sciences, animal collective behavior, earth science). Contemporary research directions will be explored through the review of recent papers, as well as with a few invited guest lecturers throughout the course.

The course and the assignments will be mainly theoretical (problems with analytical answers, open answers). Assignments can involve implementing simple numerical simulations. For this reason, it is recommended to have basic programming skills prior to taking this class.
